.NAME
    DnsServerSetting

.DESCRIPTION
    The DnsServerSetting DSC resource manages the Domain Name System (DNS) server
    settings and properties.

    If the parameter DnsServer is set to 'localhost' then the resource
    can normally use the default credentials (SYSTEM) to configure the DNS server
    settings. If using any other value for the parameter DnsServer make sure
    that the credential the resource is run as have the correct permissions
    at the target node and the necessary network traffic is permitted (WsMan
    protocol). It is possible to run the resource with specific credentials using the
    built-in parameter PsDscRunAsCredential.

    Please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnsserverpsprov/dnsserversetting
    for more information around the properties this resource supports.

If the value is zero, logging associated with the two QuietRecv properties MUST be disabled, and the QuietRecvFaultInterval property MUST be ignored.

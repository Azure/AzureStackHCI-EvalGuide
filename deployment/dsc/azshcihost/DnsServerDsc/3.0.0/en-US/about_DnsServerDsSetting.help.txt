.NAME
    DnsServerDsSetting

.SYNOPSIS
    The DnsServerDsSetting DSC resource manages DNS Active Directory settings
    on a Microsoft Domain Name System (DNS) server.

.DESCRIPTION
    The DnsServerDsSetting DSC resource manages DNS Active Directory settings
    on a Microsoft Domain Name System (DNS) server.

.PARAMETER DnsServer
    Key - System.String
    The host name of the Domain Name System (DNS) server, or use 'localhost'
    for the current node.

.PARAMETER DirectoryPartitionAutoEnlistInterval
    Write - System.String
    Specifies the interval, during which a DNS server tries to enlist itself
    in a DNS domain partition and DNS forest partition, if it is not already
    enlisted. We recommend that you limit this value to the range one hour to
    180 days, inclusive, but you can use any value. We recommend that you set
    the default value to one day. You must set the value 0 (zero) as a flag
    value for the default value. However, you can allow zero and treat it
    literally.

.PARAMETER LazyUpdateInterval
    Write - Nullable[System.UInt32]
    Specifies a value, in seconds, to determine how frequently the DNS server
    submits updates to the directory server without specifying the
    LDAPSERVERLAZYCOMMITOID control ([MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.3.4.1.7) at
    the same time that it processes DNS dynamic update requests. We recommend
    that you limit this value to the range 0x00000000 to 0x0000003c. You must
    set the default value to 0x00000003. You must set the value zero to
    indicate that the DNS server does not specify the
    LDAPSERVERLAZYCOMMITOID control at the same time that it processes
    DNS dynamic update requests. For more information about
    LDAPSERVERLAZYCOMMITOID, see LDAPSERVERLAZYCOMMITOID control
    code. The LDAPSERVERLAZYCOMMITOID control instructs the DNS server
    to return the results of a directory service modification command after
    it is completed in memory but before it is committed to disk. In this
    way, the server can return results quickly and save data to disk without
    sacrificing performance. The DNS server must send this control only to
    the directory server that is attached to an LDAP update that the DNS
    server initiates in response to a DNS dynamic update request. If the
    value is nonzero, LDAP updates that occur during the processing of DNS
    dynamic update requests must not specify the LDAPSERVERLAZYCOMMITOID
    control if a period of less than DsLazyUpdateInterval seconds has passed
    since the last LDAP update that specifies this control. If a period that
    is greater than DsLazyUpdateInterval seconds passes, during which time
    the DNS server does not perform an LDAP update that specifies this
    control, the DNS server must specify this control on the next update.

.PARAMETER MinimumBackgroundLoadThreads
    Write - Nullable[System.UInt32]
    Specifies the minimum number of background threads that the DNS server
    uses to load zone data from the directory service. You must limit this
    value to the range 0x00000000 to 0x00000005, inclusive. You must set the
    default value to 0x00000001, and you must treat the value zero as a flag
    value for the default value.

.PARAMETER PollingInterval
    Write - System.String
    Specifies how frequently the DNS server polls Active Directory Domain
    Services (AD DS) for changes in Active Directory-integrated zones. You
    must limit the value to the range 30 seconds to 3,600 seconds, inclusive.

.PARAMETER RemoteReplicationDelay
    Write - Nullable[System.UInt32]
    Specifies the minimum interval, in seconds, that the DNS server waits
    between the time that it determines that a single object has changed on
    a remote directory server, to the time that it tries to replicate a
    single object change. You must limit the value to the range 0x00000005
    to 0x00000E10, inclusive. You must set the default value to 0x0000001E,
    and you must treat the value zero as a flag value for the default value.

.PARAMETER TombstoneInterval
    Write - System.String
    Specifies the amount of time that DNS keeps tombstoned records alive in
    Active Directory. We recommend that you limit this value to the range
    three days to eight weeks, inclusive, but you can set it to any value in
    the range 82 hours to 8 weeks. We recommend that you set the default
    value to 14 days and treat the value zero as a flag value for the
    default. However, you can allow the value zero and treat it literally.
    At 2:00 A.M. local time every day, the DNS server must search all
    directory service zones for nodes that have the Active Directory
    dnsTombstoned attribute set to True, and for a directory service
    EntombedTime (section 2.2.2.2.3.23 of MS-DNSP) value that is greater
    than previous directory service DSTombstoneInterval seconds. You must
    permanently delete all such nodes from the directory server.

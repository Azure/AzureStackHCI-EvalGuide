.NAME
    DnsServerScavenging

.SYNOPSIS
    The DnsServerScavenging DSC resource manages scavenging on a Microsoft
    Domain Name System (DNS) server.

.DESCRIPTION
    The DnsServerScavenging DSC resource manages scavenging on a Microsoft
    Domain Name System (DNS) server.

.PARAMETER DnsServer
    Key - System.String
    The host name of the Domain Name System (DNS) server, or use 'localhost'
    for the current node.

.PARAMETER ScavengingState
    Write - Nullable[System.Boolean]
    Specifies whether to Enable automatic scavenging of stale records.
    ScavengingState determines whether the DNS scavenging feature is enabled
    by default on newly created zones.

.PARAMETER ScavengingInterval
    Write - System.String
    Specifies a length of time as a value that can be converted to a [TimeSpan]
    object. ScavengingInterval determines whether the scavenging feature for
    the DNS server is enabled and sets the number of hours between scavenging
    cycles. The value 0 disables scavenging for the DNS server. A setting
    greater than 0 enables scavenging for the server and sets the number of
    days, hours, minutes, and seconds (formatted as dd.hh:mm:ss) between
    scavenging cycles. The minimum value is 0. The maximum value is 365.00:00:00
    (1 year).

.PARAMETER RefreshInterval
    Write - System.String
    Specifies the refresh interval as a value that can be converted to a [TimeSpan]
    object (formatted as dd.hh:mm:ss). During this interval, a DNS server can
    refresh a resource record that has a non-zero time stamp. Zones on the server
    inherit this value automatically. If a DNS server does not refresh a resource
    record that has a non-zero time stamp, the DNS server can remove that record
    during the next scavenging. Do not select a value smaller than the longest
    refresh period of a resource record registered in the zone. The minimum value
    is 0. The maximum value is 365.00:00:00 (1 year).

.PARAMETER NoRefreshInterval
    Write - System.String
    Specifies a length of time as a value that can be converted to a [TimeSpan]
    object (formatted as dd.hh:mm:ss). NoRefreshInterval sets a period of time
    in which no refreshes are accepted for dynamically updated records. Zones on
    the server inherit this value automatically. This value is the interval between
    the last update of a timestamp for a record and the earliest time when the
    timestamp can be refreshed. The minimum value is 0. The maximum value is
    365.00:00:00 (1 year).

.PARAMETER LastScavengeTime
    Read - Nullable[System.DateTime]
    The time when the last scavenging cycle was executed.

.EXAMPLE 1

This configuration will enable scavenging and change the scavenging intervals
on the DNS server.

Configuration DnsServerScavenging_EnableAndChangeScavengingIntervals_Config
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'DnsServerDsc'

    Node localhost
    {
        DnsServerScavenging 'EnableScavengingAndChangeIntervals'
        {
            DnsServer          = 'localhost'
            ScavengingState    = $true
            ScavengingInterval = '7.00:00:00'
            RefreshInterval    = '7.00:00:00'
            NoRefreshInterval  = '7.00:00:00'
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 2

This configuration will enable scavenging on the DNS server, using
the default interval values.

Configuration DnsServerScavenging_EnableScavenging_Config
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'DnsServerDsc'

    Node localhost
    {
        DnsServerScavenging 'EnableScavenging'
        {
            DnsServer       = 'localhost'
            ScavengingState = $true
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 3

This configuration will change scavenging intervals on the DNS server, but
does not enforce that scavenging is enabled.

Configuration DnsServerScavenging_ChangeScavengingIntervals_Config
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'DnsServerDsc'

    Node localhost
    {
        DnsServerScavenging 'ChangeScavengingIntervals'
        {
            DnsServer          = 'localhost'
            ScavengingInterval = '7.00:00:00'
            RefreshInterval    = '7.00:00:00'
            NoRefreshInterval  = '7.00:00:00'
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 4

This configuration will disable scavenging on the DNS server.

Configuration DnsServerScavenging_DisableScavenging_Config
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'DnsServerDsc'

    Node localhost
    {
        DnsServerScavenging 'DisableScavenging'
        {
            DnsServer       = 'localhost'
            ScavengingState = $false
        }
    }
}

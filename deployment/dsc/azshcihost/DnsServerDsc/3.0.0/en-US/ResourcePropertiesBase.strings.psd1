    .SYNOPSIS
        The localized resource strings in English (en-US) for the
        class ResourcePropertiesBase.

    .NOTES
        This should normally not have any strings since the base class is only meant
        to have DSC properties that can be inherited. Though this localized string
        file exist so that it possible to recursively look for strings in all inherited
        classes (base classes).

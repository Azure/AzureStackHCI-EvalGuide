.NAME
    DnsServerCache

.SYNOPSIS
    The DnsServerCache DSC resource manages cache settings on a Microsoft Domain
    Name System (DNS) server.

.DESCRIPTION
    The DnsServerCache DSC resource manages cache settings on a Microsoft Domain
    Name System (DNS) server.

.PARAMETER DnsServer
    Key - System.String
    The host name of the Domain Name System (DNS) server, or use 'localhost'
    for the current node.

.PARAMETER IgnorePolicies
    Write - Nullable[System.Boolean]
    Specifies whether to ignore policies for this cache.

.PARAMETER LockingPercent
    Write - Nullable[System.UInt32]
    Specifies a percentage of the original Time to Live (TTL) value that caching
    can consume. Cache locking is configured as a percent value. For example, if
    the cache locking value is set to 50, the DNS server does not overwrite a
    cached entry for half of the duration of the TTL. If the cache locking percent
    is set to 100 that means the DNS server will not overwrite cached entries
    for the entire duration of the TTL.

.PARAMETER MaxKBSize
    Write - Nullable[System.UInt32]
    Specifies the maximum size, in kilobytes, of the memory cache of a DNS server.
    If set to 0 there is no limit.

.PARAMETER MaxNegativeTtl
    Write - System.String
    Specifies how long an entry that records a negative answer to a query remains
    stored in the DNS cache. Minimum value is '00:00:01' and maximum value is
    '30.00:00:00'

.PARAMETER MaxTtl
    Write - System.String
    Specifies how long a record is saved in cache. Minimum value is '00:00:00'
    and maximum value is '30.00:00:00'. If the TimeSpan is set to '00:00:00'
    (0 seconds), the DNS server does not cache records.

.PARAMETER EnablePollutionProtection
    Write - Nullable[System.Boolean]
    Specifies whether DNS filters name service (NS) resource records that are
    cached. Valid values are False ($false), which caches all responses to name
    queries; and True ($true), which caches only the records that belong to the
    same DNS subtree.

    When you set this parameter value to False ($false), cache pollution
    protection is disabled. A DNS server caches the Host (A) record and all queried
    NS resources that are in the DNS server zone. In this case, DNS can also cache
    the NS record of an unauthorized DNS server. This event causes name resolution
    to fail or to be appropriated for subsequent queries in the specified domain.

    When you set the value for this parameter to True ($true), the DNS server
    enables cache pollution protection and ignores the Host (A) record. The DNS
    server performs a cache update query to resolve the address of the NS if the
    NS is outside the zone of the DNS server. The additional query minimally
    affects DNS server performance.

.PARAMETER StoreEmptyAuthenticationResponse
    Write - Nullable[System.Boolean]
    Specifies whether a DNS server stores empty authoritative responses in the
    cache (RFC-2308).

.EXAMPLE 1

This configuration will change the cache settings on the DNS server.

Configuration DnsServerCache_SetCacheSettings_Config
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'DnsServerDsc'

    Node localhost
    {
        DnsServerCache 'SetCacheSettings'
        {
            DnsServer                        = 'localhost'
            EnablePollutionProtection        = $true
            StoreEmptyAuthenticationResponse = $true
            IgnorePolicies                   = $false
            LockingPercent                   = 100
            MaxKBSize                        = 0
            MaxNegativeTtl                   = '00:15:00'
            MaxTtl                           = '1.00:00:00'
        }
    }
}
